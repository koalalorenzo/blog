Since when I was little, I always loved peer-to-peer technologies... I even tried to create a GNU/Linux distribution based on that. .. but recently I have discovered a brilliant project that is combining the power of **asynchronous cryptography**, using **Bitcoin** private and public keys, with **BitTorrent technology.** This project is called [ZeroNet](http://zeronet.io) and it is a new and interesting way to provide websites and real-time services in a p2p network. <!--more-->

To join the network and browse the ZeroNet websites, now you have to **keep running a python software** in one of your **terminal**. I really hate to keep it opened 24h a day... even if I am nerd enough to love logs. I decided to run an instance of ZeroNet in background on my Mac: every time I turn on my computer, I am updating and seeding content. I feel happy to help this community üëç Here is how I made it possible. <!--more-->

First, I have created a _launchd daemon_. So I cloned the [github project repository](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet) in my home directory (~/ZeroNet).

```shell
cd ~ ; git clone https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet.git
```

Then after that I have created the launchd daemon by editing the file:

```
nano ~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.zeronet.plist
```

And adding the following content, of course **replacing** /Users/koalalorenzo with **your own home path**:

```html
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>io.zeronet</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
      <string>/Users/koalalorenzo/ZeroNet/start.sh</string>
    </array>
    <key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
    <dict>
      <key>HOME</key>
      <string>/Users/koalalorenzo/ZeroNet</string>
      <key>STNORESTART</key>
      <string>1</string>
    </dict>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
  </dict>
</plist>
```

I have then added a new script able to update the repository and run the server. So I have edited a second file:

```shell
nano ~/ZeroNet/start.sh
```

Adding in it the following simple code:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
cd /Users/koalalorenzo/ZeroNet/
git pull
sleep 5
/usr/bin/python /Users/koalalorenzo/ZeroNet/zeronet.py
```
Then I had to change the permissions of the file so the Daemon would run it:

```shell
chmod +x ~/ZeroNet/start.sh
```

The only thing missing was to launch it! So I had to activate the Daemon on launchd by running the following commands:

```shell
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.zeronet.plist
```

Once loaded, because I had every dependencies installed and it was running already before, the daemon works without errors, allowing me to browse to ZeroNet, without having a terminal opened. :)
