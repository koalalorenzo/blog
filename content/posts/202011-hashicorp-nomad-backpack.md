I recently decided to run at home a Hashicorp Nomad cluster with my Raspberry 
Pi. When I was using, I found myself writing a significant amount of HCL files 
than I expected, and I have been missing Helm's simplicity.

I have been working with Kubernetes for a while now. During this time, I had to 
install, configure, and distribute some apps using Helm. For me, it is a 
de-facto standard when it comes to deploy and maintain apps that otherwise would
require a way bigger list of YAML files. Can we do the same for Nomad Jobs's 
definitions in HCL?

So I did it for pure fun, and during my spare time: I made Nomad's Backpack! ðŸ˜€ 
I decided to keep things as similar as possible to Helm but improve on it too,
all based on my personal experience.

## a Backpack is like a chart
I am lazy; therefore, I don't want to learn a new templating language: I started 
working around the same concept to make it easy to understand. For example, the
things that are I kept similar are:

* Uses the same Go templates 
* The default configuration is a YAML file
* All lives under a single go binary
* It is easy to create, test, and deploy

## a Backpack has more than a chart

But there were a few things that I was not happy about and that I wanted to 
change. My big personal frustration was related to documentation. Often when 
there is a new version of a helm chart, the documentation for specific variables
is lost, not synced, or hard to understand. I often found myself deploying 
DataDog agents, but the version I was using was not using the same values 
defined in the documentation. 

To solve this issue, I have decided to package the documentation and the 
templates, and the values altogether. This change makes sure that the version 
I am reading is the same I am configuring and deploying.

Another feature that I wanted to improve on is that Helm chart focuses mostly on
Kubernetes as a Docker-first platform.  In Nomad, this is slightly different. 
The Job doesn't have to be necessarily a docker container! For example, it can
be a binary downloaded on the fly with the architecture. An app that would
support this is redis: you can select the Job driver to be a docker container
or a chroot-ed binary.

## Things I want to work on 

There are a few things I want to work on but had little time. I want to 
implement the packages and repository with IPFS in mind to avoid packages
disappearing. I wish Backpack was smarter and capable of reading the cluster 
configuration to pick up automatically things like the job drive to use for the
template, or like the service tags to implement to configure traefik or 
fabio-lb.  I would love to pack multiple containers, apps, and tools.

For now, I will work on it in my spare time. If somebody wants to help, I have
released the source code on GitLab!
