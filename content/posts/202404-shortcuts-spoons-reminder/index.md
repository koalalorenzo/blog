I have always been a person that organizes his day and tasks, and I have grown
over the years, a little bit too much obsessed about scheduling and prioritizing
things to do. Recently I have diagnosed as neurodivergent and I have been 
introduced to the Spoon Theory, to manage energy level.

I have made an Apple Shortcut that uses Reminders app to run based on how much
enenergy (spoons) I feel like I have on the moment and I am sharing it with you.

## A little about Spoon Theory
If you have never heard about [The Spoon Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_theory),
it is a methaphore created by Christine Miserandino in 2003, to describe the 
amount of physical or mental energy available during a day to perform tasks.

What I have learned is that you might wake up one day and have a lot of energy,
or another day when you are deplated entirely. As everybody we have things to do
and those take energy. From cleaning my flat, to sending an email or doing 
something at work. All of that takes energy, or spoons.

I have recently started taking medications, and I have found myself in a pit of
despare, laying in bed and not feeling motivated to do anything. I started my day
with one or negative amount of spoons. This might have been caused by the 
medication but a big chunk was due to the fact that I never knew how to manage
my daily amount of spoons.

Most of my spoons where taken away by social media, pressure from other people
or just having a never ending list of things to do. This made me feel drained 
even more. I reached a point where just thinking about doing something was 
extremely demotivating.

I stopped taking the pills and things did not change much. Until I started 
scheduling my tasks on Reminders and using the spoon theory with an handy 
Apple Shortcuts that would tell me what I can do on a specific moment.

## The Reminders and the Shortcuts
Apple shortcuts is an obscure, and mostly not known application, that runs on
iOS, iPadOS and macOS. It runs a list of tasks and integrates with many apps.
My passion for automation made me create a shortcut for this specific need.
Here is how it works:

I schedule (yes, with a deadline) things that I want to do on the Reminder app.
This includes stuff like _cleaning my flat_, _groceries_, _sending emails_ or
even things like _taking a relaxing shower_ sometimes. :sweat_smile:

The shortcuts fetches from the Reminder app a list of upcoming tasks. Each task
has a **tag** specifying how many spoons
