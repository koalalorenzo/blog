I miss the days when I bought software on my Mac instead of using a
subscription. More and more software and services are moving to
subscription-based models. In this blog post, I want to share my thoughts on
subscriptions, including those that I am grateful for paying for and those that
I have stopped paying for. By working with open-source software **I learned how
important it is to give back and support the developers** (and companies) that
are providing services that we like, or not paying them if we don't!

## Subscriptions and services that I am happy to pay for

There are a few services and subscriptions that make my daily life easier and
more enjoyable. I am happy to pay for them because those make me happier, or
they provide me things that I find essential.  For example, I use 
[Apple One](https://www.apple.com/apple-one/) which includes Apple Music, 
Apple TV and iCloud services. 

I really like [Mythic Quest](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/mythic-quest/umc.cmc.1nfdfd5zlk05fo1bwwetzldy3), 
See, [Severance](https://tv.apple.com/dk/show/severance/umc.cmc.1srk2goyh2q2zdxcx605w8vtx), 
and [Foundation](https://tv.apple.com/dk/show/foundation/umc.cmc.5983fipzqbicvrve6jdfep4x3) 
tv shows, but it is also about iCloud security and the software development that
keeps improving. I want to **avoid hosting my email server** or pay with my
privacy or with ads. That is why I decided to pay for it, but it can be applied
to any services based on my preferences.

I also use [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com), a software that allows me to
connect to my devices securely and fast. I use it every day to do backup on my
NAS at home from the office. This service is so much better than standard VPN,
and the company is embracing open source development. They are very transparent
about their development progress and challanges in the blog. I like that! For
what I use it for, I don't have to pay for the services, but I am happy to
support the developers behind it.

Another subscription I am grateful for is [YouTube Premium Lite](https://www.youtube.com/premiumlite), 
it’s great to be able to watch videos without having to deal with ads. As
someone who spends a lot of time on YouTube, this subscription has made a huge
difference in my viewing experience. I no longer have to sit through ads that I
don’t care about, and I can just focus on the content that I want to watch.

Talking about advertisement, [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io) is another service
that I pay for. I used to have [PiHole](https://pi-hole.net), then switched to 
[AdGuard](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome), but since Raspberry Pis
are hard to buy today, I prefer to **pay this service rather than maintain it** 
at home. I can now enjoy my online experience without being constantly bombarded
by ads, and I think it’s worth the cost, considering that is way more stable
than a RPi. Not only that, but I would switch to AdGuard, but I _avoid running
any Russian developed software_ until the end of the war.

[LanguageTool](http://languagetool.org/) is a European-funded, multi-language 
tool that I discovered after using Grammarly for a long time, it has full API 
access and integration with 
[Slack, Mail, and more native macOS apps](https://languagetool.org/mac-desktop). 
This tool has been a great help for me, as I use it for both my personal and
professional writing. _Heck!_ I am using it right now to write this post! :wink: 
It’s great that it supports **multiple languages**, and the fact that it has full
API access and integration with other apps is a massive plus 
([Obsidian](https://languagetool.org/insights/post/product-obsidian/) and
LibreOffice plugins are available).

[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) is an open-source and (optionally)
self-hosted alternative to the now bloated 1Password. Even if it is written in
C#, there is a 
[slimmer version of the backend re-written in Rust](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) 
that can run on a raspberry pi without many issues. I pay for the service mostly
to keep the security and keep developing it. It might not have the best UI, or
slick design, but it at least they did not disappointed me :cry: 
_More on that later!_

Email privacy is something that I value. [SimpleLogin](http://simplelogin.io/) 
is a valuable service that even though it has been bought by Proton, it offers
more than Apple/iCloud Hide My mail because **I can own my email domain**. I
have more control over my emails and, which is great in case of leaks or spam. 
I also like that it’s been bought by Proton, as it gives me more confidence in
the security and privacy of my email. SimpleLogin is also open source and can
be self-hosted. :sweat_smile: _though I prefer to pay rather to
run an email server!_ 

About social networks, I am supporting [Mastodon](http://joinmastodon.org/) with
a small monthly payment on [Patreon](https://joinmastodon.org/sponsors). _Why?_
I moved out from Twitter and deleted all references from my account. I never
paid for Twitter. If I did, I would waste my money and give them directly to
Musk with no benefits. :fu:  Instead, I prefer to **pay for the development** of
a decentralized and open-source project, that offers multiple instances for free
for many people. Not everybody can pay, so I am because I like it better this
way and **I want to see them succeed**.

## Services I am not paying anymore

I have stopped paying for several subscriptions that I found were not worth the
cost or no longer met my needs.  One of those is **Netflix**. I used to enjoy
the wide range of content that it offered, but over time, the **movies and
series that I cared about was removed**, and the new things are not interesting
to me. I would rather not subscribe just for one single TV show. :rage: So, the
trick they use "_that show that keep you subscribed_" does not work to me

There is a service that I have been paying for **more than 6 years**, and now I
realized it was not worth it: **ProtonMail**, from being an end-to-end email
provider, it became just a glorified encryption at rest with PGP that can’t keep
up with features that others can. I used to appreciate the level of security
that ProtonMail provided, but as time went on, I found that it was lacking in
certain features that other email providers offered. Their support for
open-source software was good, as well as their way of being transparent.
Sadly, the dream of having **end-to-end encrypted email turned out unrealistic**
unless everybody uses ProtonMail or PGP/GPG encryption in their client. This
meant that my PGP key is only used at rest and to encrypt a limited number of
emails **from Facebook** :open_mouth: _Really!_ That is the only service that
can send OpenPGP encrypted emails: [Set it yourself
here](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=security).

One that I stopped using is the **Nintendo Switch Online**: I rarely use my
Switch since I got my **Steam Deck** at the beginning of this year. I found that
the Steam Deck offered a wider range of games and better graphics, and it was
more convenient for me to play on my Mac and Deck rather than on my Switch. I
also found that the subscription cost for Nintendo Switch Online was not really
useful: the included emulators are fun, but I never used them. So, I have
decided not to pay anymore.

The Danish Postal service (Post Nord) automatically notifies me and tracks
packages on the official App when a new parcel is coming to my address or has my
email/phone number. I found that more convenient and more reliable than the
**Parcel App**, that I was paying for. I had to mention it because Parcel
supports Amazon and a lot of tracking services, so if you are not in Denmark, I
strongly suggest it! :thumbsup:

Should we talk about dating apps? I have been paying for years for **Grindr
Xtra**...  it has never been worth it, and ads blockers are making the user
experience better for non-paying users. I found out that the services offered
were not that good, since privacy does not exists on that app anyway. The app
kept crashing and had plenty of bugs and issues that were never fixed in the
serveral years I paid for... :rage: When I lost all my chats (_yeah! it is not a
myth_) I was super annoyed and decided not to pay for the app.

**1Password** is the worst one so far. Since they switched and abbandoned the
development of the ultra-fast and stable native app, in favor of an
**Electron-based/JavaScript app**, I uninstalled it and unsubscribed.  It is
clear that they are now focusing more on enterprise and business, but I am still
annoyed about how they went for the money rather than for the UX and customer
fidelity. I found that the new electron-based client was slow and bloated, and
**I didn’t like the direction the company was going in anymore**. After more
than 10 years of using it and paying, after switching to their subscription
model, I decided to cancel it. All it took was some [messages with the CTO on
Twitter](https://nitter.net/koalalorenzo/status/1522978667445501952#m): I felt
not understood nor heard about keeping the native app running. I felt that
1Password switched from being customer-first to be money-driven, and unsecure. I
turned to Bitwarden that at least is open-source and worth paying for.

## Give back to the communities
Plenty of companies are **firing people** right now. :sob: Inflation and several
other factors are making things **more difficult than usual**. That is why I
feel it’s important to support the development of software that we care about,
especially for open-source projects. Open-source projects rely on contributions
from the community and companies, both in terms of development and financial
support. By paying for subscriptions or buying apps from companies that
contribute to FOSS, we are supporting the development and maintenance of these
projects.

Without contribution or financial support, many **open-source projects would
struggle** to continue development and maintenance. We can show our support by
becoming a sponsor, paying for a subscription, or buying apps from companies
that contribute to open-source software. In this way, we are not only getting
access to the software, but we are also contributing to the growth and
sustainability of the project. Supporting open-source projects is a way to give
back to the community and ensure that the software continues to be maintained,
improved and available for all. That should not apply exclusively to Patreon or
donating to developers, but also to **companies that are doing the right
thing**. I don't like to **pay with my own privacy** or data. :rage: I prefer to
pay with money. :euro: TL;DR: If you liked it: contribute or pay for it!
