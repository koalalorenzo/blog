I have been writing a journal for the last 10 years. This diary helped me a lot
and I want to write down a few things that I discovered to celebrate this
achievement that I thought it was impossible. At the same time, I wish to help
who is not sure if starting one to do so, or not. Those are my personal
observation.

<!-- more -->

The main reason why I started writing a diary is that I wanted to avoid that
cognitive bias. I also wanted to learn more from myself and discover how I
process emotions and time. When I was 16 I noticed how easy it was for some
people to forget some bad experiences with other people.Sure, people can
change... but I want to say how it is important to remember and evaluate a
bigger picture.

I always thought that time is like one of these old movies on highly flammable
tape. One of those like in [Cinema Paradiso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_Paradiso),
and we are the little Toto super curious to see how the story goes.

We can always cut the tape and re-arrange it, give some editing. We delete
scenes that we don't want in our final cut. Hell yeah, we do even some CGI if we
like it better than what the lenses captured!

But that is precisely the issue: Time flows fast, and I noticed how my brain can
re-arrange it to make me feel better about anything even if that is not the
reality. To me, writing down my life events and memories helps to keep the story
coherent.

If some editing happens, that is ok. More or less I will be aware of both the
stories: the one that I lived on the same day I wrote on the journal, and the
one that I want to remember.

I met so many people who gave me such big joy in my life. For one reason or
another, they are no longer characters in my film. Some are no longer with us,
some others argued with me, and others moved on to the next chapter of
their movie. In any case, I still remember both the happiness and the sadness
that they caused me in different moments, without holding any specific feelings.

Those were different part of my movie, those were different chapters of the
story and different people.

## I write to improve myself

I learned a lot more in the last 5 years thanks to the diary about compassion,
towards other people and towards myself. For example, one thing that I have
noticed during the last 10 years by reading is how easy it is to go back and
say: _Oh! That was stupid of me!_  

It is super easy to have regrets or feel ashamed of something that happened.
My diary gives me the instrument to reflect on my reflection when I look back:
I assume that it is normal to want to do better, even if the things that we want
to do better are in the past. That is a valid point to improve ourselves.

The important thing about regrets is to know that I am learning. I am improving
myself so that if something similar happens in the future, I will know what
to do. We are more than allowed to be ashamed of it, too. It is in a past and
old part of the tape of our movie.

## Being present and living the moment

I have to be personal here. I noticed how writing a diary and forcing myself to
describe as much as possible the details helped me to be present. I still
struggle a lot with it, and sometimes time flows too quickly. Writing
down what I saw, the emotions, the sensations, or small details of my experience
does not only enrich the story, but it allows me to teleport mentally when I am
reading back again the page.

## What do I use and how often?

I have been using [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com) for the last 10 years. It is
a decent journaling software that has superb features like tags, geolocation and
a nice text editor.

I tried to move to other solutions unsuccessfully. It works perfectly with my
iPhone, iPad, and Mac and it has features that helps me go back in time and
reflect. I can see what I wrote today, but during the years and review a
specific scene of the movie.

At the beginning, I was writing it every day or even more. It used to be my
companion before going to bed, but now it I can't find the time and I write only
when I feel like. In the last 3/4 years, after burning out at work, I
found myself writing once or twice a week. Being honest, I feel guilty of not
writing every day anymore. I am scared of forgetting things, missing memories
and not calming my mind down, but that is a pressure I don't want to have.

## This show has everything

I wrote almost the entirety of my 20s. Toto from Cinema Paradiso might say
that this tape is a perfect pilot for a TV show instead of a single movie! Why
limiting to a long feature film when you can have:

* a spy episode about me trying to organize a surprise birthday party
* a thriller, the one when I drank far too much with the wrong people
* an adventure one, about dates and hookups on Grindr and trips around the world
* an adult-themed one about exploring sexuality and experimenting
* a comedy episode about that time I had a seizure in the cinema
* a sci-fi one where I talk about work and projects that I never finished
* a LGBTQ+ horror one about that time I got hurt by a homophobic guy
* a dramatic episode when you feel alone because you live abroad
* a love story filled with plot twists about finding friends and the right man

Even if the story will be inconsistent and too few recurring characters, I am
sure Trixie and Katya would say that [this](https://youtu.be/6nvDC9YSMvQ?t=1310)

[has](https://youtu.be/Wmw9WcFe9Mo?t=1142)
[everything](https://youtu.be/jKMGFaF1YbE?t=1034): drama, love,
suspense, sex, blood, and laughs... and Toto would love it too!

Seriously speaking, I do suggest writing a journal! Be aware: It is a habit that
takes time, as going to the gym or learning a new language. It takes time and I
found it helped me to achieve other goals.
