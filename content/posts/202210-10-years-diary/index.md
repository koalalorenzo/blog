I have been writing a journal for the last 10 years. This diary helped me a lot
and I want to write down a few things that I discovered to celebrate this
achievement that I thought it was impossible. At the same time, I wish to help
who is not sure if starting one to do so, or not. Those are my personal
observation.

I started writing a diary because I wanted to **avoid cognitive biases** and
have a more objective memory for my future self. I also wanted to learn more
from myself and discover how I process emotions and time. Before starting
writing the diary, I noticed that **a single bad experience can change our
prospective to over 100 different positive experiences**.

Out of 100 packages being delivered perfectly, that single package that is
broken will make us complain to the post office! The same is valid for people,
and time has an effect on it.

I always thought that time is like one of these old movies on highly flammable
tape. üìΩ One of those like in [Cinema Paradiso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_Paradiso),
and we are the young Tot√≥ (Salvatore) super curious to see how the story goes.

Because it is our film, we can always cut the tape and re-arrange it, give
some editing. We delete scenes that we don't want in our final cut. _Hell yeah_,
we do even some CGI if we like it better than what the cameras captured!

But that is precisely the issue: Time flows... fast! I noticed how my brain can
re-arrange events to make me feel better about anything, even if that is not the
reality. To me, writing down my life events and memories helps to keep the story
coherent, especially in the future when I will forget most of the details.

If some editing happens, that is ok. More or less, I will be aware of both the
stories: the one that I chose to remember and what I wrote on the journal. Our
brain does not have infinite space, and we use a very [lossy compression
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_compression)! ü§£

I met a lot of people who gave me joy in the past 10 years. For one reason or
another, they are no longer characters in my film. Some are no longer with us
üíÄ some others argued with me üíî, and others moved on to the next chapter of
their movie ‚úàÔ∏è. Thanks to my diary, **I still remember both the happiness and the
sadness** that they caused me in different moments, without holding any specific
feelings as the only way to remember them.

## I write to improve myself

Thanks to the diary, I learned about compassion towards other people and towards
myself. For example,¬†one thing that I have noticed during the last 10 years by
reading is how easy it is to go back and say: _Oh! That was stupid of me!_ ¬†

It is super easy to have **regrets or feel ashamed of something that happened**.
My diary gives me the instrument to reflect on my reflection when I look back:
I assume that it is normal to want to do better, even if the things that we want
to improve are in the past. I am not an expert, but I believe that regrets and
shame are powerful mechanisms for self-improvement.

The important thing about regrets is to know that I am learning. I am improving
myself so that if something similar happens in the future, I will know what
to do.

## Being present and living the moment

Another thing that I noticed is that writing a diary and forcing myself to
describe as much as possible the details, helped me to be present and live
the moment.

I still struggle a lot with it, and sometimes time flows too quickly.
Writing down what I saw, the emotions, the sensations, or small details of my
experience does not only enrich the story, but it allows me to teleport mentally
when I am reading back again the page. I am forcing myself to look around more,
to capture feelings  and sensation in my everyday life so that I will be forced
to write it down  later.

The opposite scares me a lot: not being able to enjoy the important moments of
my life and reaching an old age where I didn't pay attention to things that
matter. üò± I am scared of having passed my whole life in front of a screen or
phone rather than looking at the colors of the leaves or the smile on people's
face.

## What do I use and how often?

I have been using [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com) for the last 10 years. It is
a decent journaling software that has superb features like tags, geolocation and
a nice text editor. It helps me by adding more information/metadata than the
analog counterpart: pen and paper!

I tried to move to other solutions unsuccessfully. It works perfectly with my
iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and it has features that help me go back in time and
reflect: I can see what I wrote on the same day a few years back. It is like
selecting a chapter on our movie.

{{< image src="dayone-map.webp" class="square" caption="Day One has a built-in Map and geolocation">}}

At the beginning, **I was writing it every day or even more**. It used to be my
companion before going to bed, but now I can't find the time and I write only
when I feel like. In the last 3/4 years, after burning out at work, I
found myself writing once or twice a week. Being honest, I feel guilty of not
writing every day anymore. I am scared of forgetting things, missing memories
and not calming my mind down, but that is a pressure I would rather not feel.
That is why I write when I feel like writing: it should not be a cause of
stress.

## This show has everything

I wrote almost the entirety of my 20s. From September 2012 until now. I will
continue writing. Toto from Cinema Paradiso might say that this tape is a
perfect pilot for a TV show instead of a single movie! Why limiting to a long
feature film when you can have:

* a spy episode about me trying to organize a surprise birthday party
* a thriller, the one when I drank far too much with the wrong people
* an adventure one, about dates and hookups on Grindr in Japan
* a comedy episode about that time I had a seizure in the cinema
* an adult-themed one about exploring sexuality and experimenting new things
* a sci-fi one about work and projects that I never finished ü§£
* a LGBTQ+ horror one about that time I woke up filled with bruises in somebody's flat
* a dramatic episode when you feel alone because you live abroad
* a romantic episode filled with plot twists about finding friends and the right man

Even if the story will be inconsistent and too few recurring characters, I am
sure Trixie and Katya would say that [this](https://youtu.be/6nvDC9YSMvQ?t=1310)
[show](https://youtu.be/8jqs2XKe3Xg?t=1206)
[has](https://youtu.be/Wmw9WcFe9Mo?t=1142)
[everything](https://youtu.be/jKMGFaF1YbE?t=1034): drama, love,
suspense, sex, blood, and laughs... and Toto would love it too!

Seriously speaking, what I want to say is that writing down things helps me
remember important events of my life, more than a bullet point list of episodes.
I think the people in these episodes were living their own film, and there might
be other diaries with a different plot. No single diary is better than another.
Life is a rollercoaster of events for everyone.

**I do suggest writing a journal**. It helped me so much in the past 10 years:
I would be an entirely different person without it. If you are in doubt,
I hope that this convinced you: now it is your turn: _what did you do today?_
and will you remember this day in 10 years? üòâ
