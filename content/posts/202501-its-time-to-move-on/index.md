In the past few months, I started thinking about how I use social networks
and the impact they have on my life. Today, I took a strong decision: it’s
time to move on from Instagram, a platform that is clearly **no longer a social
network**. _How did we get here? Where are we going?_
I need to dig deeper into my past personal experience with the social network
to really understand why I am going to use Mastodon and Pixelfed.

## My Instagram experience

I have been on Instagram since 2011, way before even Facebook acquired it,
way before Facebook was called Meta. It might not be news to you, but back
then it was very different: people were posting photos of their food, café
latte art, and having a filter was a must!

I did not have anything original posted there, and I started using it
only when **I moved to Denmark around 11 years ago**. Things started changing
then: it was both a way to keep my family and friends up-to-date with my
life. Instagram was the social network to post photos of places I have been,
cool things I was doing, and see what my friends were up to. Instantly
uploading a picture about my travel experience was exciting!

Later on, it became a way to **showcase my gym progress**. :muscle: I became extremely
happy to share and felt spikes of dopamine from the appreciation of other
people. Receiving a like was so satisfying that it made me super engaged
with the platform. I started following people that I barely knew to feel
inspired by their progress and their hard work. It was useful and rewarding.

## Then there were memes

In the last few years, things started slowly changing. With the **TikTok
mania**, Instagram and Facebook copied that idea, and both became sources of a
**never-ending scroll** of content that was no longer from my friends. :fearful:
The developers have even removed the friends from my main timeline and added the
_Following_ and _Favorites_ tabs, where _For you_ would be the default timeline
tailored to keep me glued on content that I barely was interested in.

This also changed a lot in the way I interacted with my friends: Instagram
is no longer about checking what they are up to and talking about it. It is
about sending messages with memes and stupid videos. Some people consider
that being close, and I fell into that trap.

How long does it take for you to see a post from somebody close to you in the
timeline? How many posts do you need to scroll?

## Losing touch with friends

Right now, if I scroll on my _For You_ timeline, I can’t see a single post
from my social circle: none of these people are my friends. :cry: If there is
a post of somebody I follow, it’s somebody that I never met, or I met once.

Most of the content on Instagram is clearly AI-generated. Some videos and posts
even clearly try to **polarize me with political or very opinionated themes**
that just disturb me. They cause emotions that would keep me engaged, in a
bad way. With the latest policy changes from Meta, Facebook, and Twitter with
the American Nazi shenanigans, I had enough. :cry:

I feel it was _slowly cooked_. In the past year, I noticed how 2 people
started sending me more and more memes of things that are disturbing.
Topics like pronouns, gender equality, abortion, transphobia, violence, racism,
and homophobia are now clearly memes and jokes. What once was important things
to fight for to them and to my community, slowly became something to laugh about
the more it was **pushed by the algorithm**. :rage: Is it really tailored?

_If it is on the platform and people are just laughing about it, it must be
acceptable to ridicule marginalized people, right?_ Except, that hurts people.

Today it is my birthday, and clearly a very few friends remembered. Those that
I shared memes with did not wish me a happy birthday, while in the past that
would have been very common. :worried: The social part of Instagram is clearly
gone, and it is time to move on.

## I have been here before

A few years ago, I **stopped using Facebook** for very similar reasons. The
price I paid back then was **loneliness**: I was no longer invited to events,
and rarely read messages to not get sucked into Facebook again.

I was forced back on Facebook just to handle the volunteering at my LGBTQ+
Volleyball club. :tired_face: When I log in on it, the feeling is the
same: the content on the platform is even worse than when I left, and it
shares the same issue as Instagram. Thankfully, I don't feel addicted to
Facebook anymore and I can clearly close the app and move on with my day.

I also **stopped using Twitter** for the similar reasons. Leaving was easy this
time. I have been using RSS feeds from blogs and news websites for a long time.
On top of that, **Mastodon provided me with a better experience** than Twitter.
Bluesky does not offer anything different than Twitter, and the people and
companies that I want to follow are on Mastodon already.

## What is next?

I have looked for years into a few alternatives. The problem with that is
that all of them require people to move to those platforms.

The most exciting one for me was [Manyverse](https://manyver.se),
where meeting in-person is kinda-required in order to get their timeline
updates. The protocol ([Scuttlebutt](https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/))
and the idea behind it are very interesting. Back in 2019, I used to support
the project financially with donations, but nowadays, the app development
seems stagnant. There are still too many technicalities to overcome before
making it a full product usable by my friends and my mother. :sweat_smile:

The ones that I will use are **Pixelfed and Mastodon**. These are
more robust platforms that can interconnect and talk to each other even. It is
mind-blowing that I can see Pixelfed posts on a Mastodon app. It could be
a nice idea to use it independently on the instance where all my friends are.
I can self-host my profile/instance instead of relying on one overflowing with
advertisement and nazi propaganda. I will probably move my photos from
Instagram to a Pixelfed instance. There are guides and tools to automate the
process after exporting the data from Meta.

Today **I have deleted all my posts from Instagram**, except my very first post:
a photo of my mom’s Pizza di Scarola back from 2011. I hope people will
remember those days, and that social networks will not make me feel lonely again.
I don't want an algorithm that makes me enraged just to squize money and time.
It will be difficult since **it will take time for my peers to change platform**,
and it will take time to rebuild the social network. I'll go first, as it's
time for me to move on!
