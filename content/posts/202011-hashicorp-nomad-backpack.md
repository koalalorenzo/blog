I recently decided to replace my k8s home cluster with a **Hashicorp Nomad**
cluster on my 3 Raspberry Pis. When I was using it, I found myself writing a
significant amount of HCL files, and I have been missing Helm's simplicity.

As an SRE, I have been working with Kubernetes for a while now. During this time, 
I had to install, configure, and distribute some apps using Helm. For me, it is 
a de-facto standard when it comes to deploy and maintain apps that otherwise 
would require a way bigger list of YAML files. Can we do the same for Nomad 
Jobs's definitions?

Yes, we can! For pure fun and during my spare time, I made **Backpack** for Nomad!
ðŸ˜€ I decided to keep things as similar as possible to Helm but improve on it
too, all based on my personal experience.

```bash
# Please check the README.md as this might be outdated! ðŸ˜‰
go get -v gitlab.com/Qm64/backpack
cd $GOPATH/src/gitlab.com/Qm64/backpack/
make install
# Check that it works:
backpack help
```

_Hint_: I left some _TL;DR_ in the [README.md](https://gitlab.com/Qm64/backpack/-/blob/master/README.md)
to quick start Nomad and test out backpack! ðŸ˜‰ Also note, that this article
is written on version 0.1.0... things might change.

## A Backpack is like a chart
I am lazy ðŸ˜… therefore, I don't want to learn a new language: I started working
around something similar to what I am used to so that it would be easy to
understand and use. For example, the things that are I kept similar are:

* Backpack Uses the same **Go templates** and extra functions[^templates]
* The default configuration/values is a **YAML** file[^format]
* All done with a single Go binary
* It is easy to create, test, and deploy new packs[^binhelp]

[^templates]: I am using go templates with [Sprig](https://github.com/Masterminds/sprig)
  as Helm.

[^format]: YAML might not be the most loved format, I do believe I can adjust
  the code to support multiple human-readable formats ðŸ¤”

[^binhelp]: I think the core is to make it easy: `backpack help` might do the
  trick!

To get started you can create a boilerplate directory structure:

```bash
backpack create my-app
```

This command just created a directory `my-app-0.1.0` with `values.yaml`
containing the default values passed to the Go templates.

## A Backpack is not just YAML

But there were a few things that I was not happy about and that I wanted to
change. My big personal frustration was related to **documentation**. Often when
there is a new version of a helm chart, the documentation for specific variables
is lost, not synced, or hard to understand. ðŸ™„ I often found myself deploying
DataDog agents, but the version I was using was not using the same values
defined in the documentation.

![reading docs](/posts/202011/reading.gif)

To solve this issue, I have decided to package the documentation and the
templates, and the values altogether. This change makes sure that the version
I am reading is the same I am configuring and deploying.

```bash
backpack unpack docs https://backpack.qm64.tech/examples/redis-6.0.0.backpack
```

This command just created a directory `redis-6.0.0` containing only the Markdown
files for the documentation. ðŸ˜Ž No more googling, or searching on github commits
history. It is right there, next to the code!

Another feature that I wanted to improve on is that Helm chart focuses mostly on
Kubernetes as a Docker-first platform. In Hashicorp Nomad, this is slightly
different.
[A Job doesn't have to be necessarily a docker container](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers)!
It can be a binary downloaded on the fly with the architecture. An app that
would support this is redis: you can select the Job driver to be a docker
container or a chroot-ed binary[^jobdriver].

[^jobdriver]: This is still a work-in-progress feature. I just need to manually
  implement it in every template for now. Please check the documentation of the
  backpack to know what drivers are supported!

```bash
# This is an example to use exec (chroot)
echo "driver: exec" > values.yaml
backpack run https://backpack.qm64.tech/examples/redis-6.0.0.backpack -f values.yaml

# Switch to use Docker
echo "driver: docker" > values.yaml
backpack run https://backpack.qm64.tech/examples/redis-6.0.0.backpack -f values.yaml
```

## Future plans for the project

This is just a starting point. I made this for myself, but I other poeple could
find it useful as I do! ðŸ¤ž

There are a few things I want to work on but had little time. I want to
implement the packages and repository with [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) in mind to
avoid packages disappearing. I wish Backpack was smarter and capable of reading
the cluster configuration to pick up automatically things like the job drive to
use for the template, or like the service tags to implement to configure
[traefik](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/nomad/load-balancing-traefik)
or [fabio-lb](https://fabiolb.net). I would love to pack multiple containers,
apps, and tools, solve issues like dependency management and more...

![I will do that later](/posts/202011/karenwalker-later.gif#smallSquare)

For now, I will work on it in my spare time. I have released the source code on
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Qm64/backpack), and if you want to help feel free
to ask a question on the
[Matrix chatroom](https://matrix.to/#/#qm64:matrix.org?via=matrix.org) or leave
a comment to this post!
