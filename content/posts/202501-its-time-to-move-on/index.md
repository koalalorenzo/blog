In the past few months, I started thinking about how I use social networks
and the impact they have on my life. Today, I took a strong decision: it's
time to move on from Instagram, a platform that is clearly no longer a social
network based on my expectations. But where to? I need to dig deeper into my
past personal experience with the social network to really understand why I am
going to use Mastodon and Pixelfed.

## My Instagram experience

I have been on the Instagram since 2011, way before even Facebook acquired
it, way before Facebook was called Meta. It might not be news to you, but
back then it was very different: people were posting photos of their food,
caffe latte art, and having a filter was a must!

I did not have anything original posted there, and I started using it only when
I moved to Denmark around 11 years ago. Things started changing then: it was
both a way to keep my family up-to-date with my life and a way to post photos
of places I have been, projects that I was doing, and see what my friends were
up to. Instantly uploading a picture about my travel experience was exciting!

Later on, it became a way to showcase my gym progress. I became extremely
happy to share and felt spikes of dopamine from the appreciation of other
people. Receiving a like was so satisfying that it made me super engaged
with the platform. I started following people that I barely knew to feel
inspired by their progress and their hard work.

## Meme-a-la-carte

In the last few years, things started slowly changing. With the TikTok mania,
Instagram and Facebook became sources of a never-ending scroll of content
that was no longer from my friends. They have even removed the friends from
my main timeline and added the "Following" and "Favorites" tabs, where "For
you" would be the default timeline tailored to keep me glued on content that
I barely was interested in.

This also changed a lot in the way I interacted with my friends: Instagram
is no longer about checking what they are up to and talking about it. It is
about sending messages with memes and stupid videos. Some people consider
that being close, and I fell into that trap.

## Loosing touch with friends

Right now, if I scroll on my "For You" timeline, I can't see a single post
from my social circle: none of these people are my friends. If there is a
post of somebody I follow, it's somebody that I never met, or I met once.

The content on Instagram is clearly AI-generated. Some videos and posts even
clearly try to polarize me with political or very opinionated things that just
disturb me. They cause emotions that would keep me engaged, in a bad way. With
the latest changes from Meta, Facebook, and Twitter with the American Nazi
shenanigans, I had enough. Now it has been made official by Facebook/Meta,
but I feel it was brewed slowly. In the past year, I noticed how 2 people
started sending me memes of things that are disturbing. Topics like
pronouns, gender equality, abortion, transphobia, racism and homophobia
are clearly memes and jokes, changing something that is important to my
community into something that I am pushed to laugh about. If it is on the
platform and people are just laughing about it, it must be acceptable to
ridicule marginalized people... right?

Today it is my birthday, and clearly a very few friends remembered. Those that
I shared memes with did not wish me a happy birthday, while in the past that
would have been very common. The Social part of Instagram is clearly gone,
and it is time to move on.

## When I stopped using Facebook and Twitter

A few years ago, I stopped using Facebook for very similar reasons. The
price I paid back then was loneliness: I was no longer invited to events,
and rarely I was reading messages. I was forced back on Facebook just to
handle the volunteering at my LGBTQ+ Volleyball club. When I started using
it again, the feeling did not change: the content on the platform is even
worse than when I left, and it shares the same issue as Instagram.

I also stopped using Twitter for the same reason. Leaving was easy. I have
been using RSS feeds from blogs and news websites for a long time. On top
of that, Mastodon provided me with a better experience than Twitter, and I
am still using it today.

## What is next?

I have looked for years into a few alternatives. The problem with that is
all of them require people to move to those platforms.Â 

The most exciting one for me was Manyverse, where you can meet people
in order to get their timeline updates (or do it online). The protocol
(scuttlebutt) and the idea behind it are very interesting. Back in 2019,
I used to support the project financially with donations, but nowadays, the
app development seems stagnating. There are still too many technicalities
to overcome before making it a full product usable by my friends and my mother.

The ones that I can easily settle for are Pixelfed and Mastodon. These are
more robust platforms that can interconnect and talk to each other. It is
mind-blowing that I can see Pixelfed posts on a Mastodon app. It could be
a nice idea to use an instance where all my friends are, instead of relying
on one overflown by advertisement and Nazi propaganda. I will probably move
content to a Pixelfed instance, there are guides and tools to automate the 
process after exporting the data from Instagram.

Today I have deleted all my posts from Instagram, except my very first post: a
photo of my mom's Pizza di Scarola back from 2011. I hope people will remember
those days. I just hope that the next social networks will not make me feel
lonely and enraged by their content. I hope they will help me connect with my
friends instead!
