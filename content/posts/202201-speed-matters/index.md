Recently I have been travelling with a bad airplane company that lost my 
luggage. In hope to get my belongings back with me, I tried to use their
website and support page, just to be super frustrated every time. The main
reason of frustration, besides the lack of any form of support, was the 
website speed. So I decided to spend the time without my luggage (around 5 days)
trying to use best practices to improve the speed of my own website and blog.

## Investigations
On my way to Recife, from Copenhagen, on an airplane from TAP Airplines I 
realised that my luggage was stuck in Copenhagen. My Apple AirTag helped me a 
lot, but I could not do much besides trying to use a unusable website.

So I inspected the website a little further and I realised that [FlyTAP.com 
homepage weights around 17MB](flytap.com-size.webp). On a bad hotel WiFi it was
impossible to sort things out from the website. Worse if it was from my iPhone,
as the Mobile app was even worse.
