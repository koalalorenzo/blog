I have been writing a journal for the last 10 years. This diary helped me a lot
and I want to write down a few things that I discovered in order to celebrate
this achievement that I thought it was impossible. At the same time I want to
help who is not sure if starting one to do so, or not. Those are my personal
observation

The main reason why I started writing a diary is because I wanted to avoid that
cognitive bias that makes us change prospective and forget things. When I was 16
I noticed how easy it was for some people to forget how bad something or
somebody has been. See how for example some Italian politician and parties that
were against the people from south of italy, now all of a sudden are popular.
I don’t want to say that people can’t change, but I want to say how it is
important to remember and evaluate accordingly. I always thought about my idea
of time as one of these old movies on tape. One of those flammable tapes
directly from CinemaP, and we are the little $(name) super curious to see how
the story goes. We can always cut the tape and re-arrange it, give some editing.
Hell, yeah even some CGI if we want. But that is exactly the issue. Time flows
and our brain can re-arrange it to make us feel sad or happy about almost
anything. To me, writing it down helps to keep the story coherent.  If some
editing happen, that is ok. I will be aware of both the stories: the one that I
lived on the same day I wrote on the journal, and the one that I want
to remember.

I met so many people that gave me such big joy in my life, and for one reason of
another I argued with, they left our world for a better one or they moved on to
the next chapter of their movie. In any case I still remember both the happiness
and the sadness that they caused me in different moments, without holding any
specific feelings. Those were different part of my movie, those were different
chapters of the story and different people.

# The repeated life events. How do I react?

# Focusing on the right things to do next

# Observe not what you are talking about but how you are talking about it

# Achievements and what triggers

# Self-reflecting loops breaks

# Comparing the past with the present
