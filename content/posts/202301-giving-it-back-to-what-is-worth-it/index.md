I miss the days when I bought software on my Mac instead of using a subscription

## Give back to the community

## Subscriptions that I am grateful for

* Apple One: I daily use Apple Music, and I love Apple TV productions like
  Mythic Quest, See and Foundation
* Tailscale: I use this software every day
* Youtube Premium lite: Fuck ads
* NextDNS: I used to have PiHole and AdGuard but since Raspberry Pis are hard to find, I prefer to pay this service rather than maintain it at home just to say: fuck ads
* LanguageTool: After using Gramamrly for long time, I discovered this european-based, multi language tool that has full API access and integration with Slack, Mail and more native macOS apps.
* Bitwarden: Being opensource and self-hosted alternative to bloated electron-based 1Password. After 10 years of using 1Password I got disgusted by the CTO replies on twitter.
* SimpleLogin: Even if now it has been bought by Proton, it offers a valuable service, more than Apple Hide My mail

## Subscriptions that I am no longer grateful for

* Netflix: content that I cared was removed
* ProtonMail: from being an end-to-end email provider it became just a glorified encryption at rest with PGP that can't keep up with features that others can
* Nintendo Switch Online: Since I got my Steam Deck at the beginning of this year, I rarely used my Switch
* Parcel App: The Danish postal system automatically notify me and tracks on the official App when a new parcel is coming to my address or has my email/phone number
* Grindr: It has never been worth it and NextDNS blocks perfectly the ads.
* 1Password: Since the client switched to Electron, I uninstalled it. It is clear that they are now focusing more on enterprise and business.
