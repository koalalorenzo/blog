I miss the days when I bought software on my Mac instead of using a
subscription. More and more software and services are moving to
subscription-based models. In this blog post, I want to share my thoughts on
subscriptions, including those that I am grateful for paying for and those that
I have stopped paying for. By working with open-source software I learned how
important it is to give back and support the developers (and companies) that are
providing services that we like, or not paying them if we don't!

## Subscriptions and services that I am happy to pay for
There are a few services and subscriptions that make my daily life easier and
more enjoyable. I am happy to pay for them because those make me happier, or
they provide me things that I find essential.  For example, I use 
[Apple One](https://www.apple.com/apple-one/) which includes Apple Music, 
Apple TV and iCloud services. 

I really like [Mythic Quest](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/mythic-quest/umc.cmc.1nfdfd5zlk05fo1bwwetzldy3), 
See, [Severance](https://tv.apple.com/dk/show/severance/umc.cmc.1srk2goyh2q2zdxcx605w8vtx), 
and [Foundation](https://tv.apple.com/dk/show/foundation/umc.cmc.5983fipzqbicvrve6jdfep4x3) 
tv shows, but it is also about iCloud security and the software development that
keeps improving. I want to **avoid hosting my email server** or pay with my
privacy or with ads. That is why I decided to pay for it, but it can be applied
to any services based on my preferences.

I also use [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com), a software that allows me to
connect to my devices securely and fast. I use it every day to do backup on my
NAS at home from the office. This service is so much better than standard VPN,
and the company is embracing open source development. They are very transparent
about their development progress and challanges in the blog. I like that! For
what I use it for, I don't have to pay for the services, but I am happy to
support the developers behind it.

Another subscription I am grateful for is [YouTube Premium Lite](https://www.youtube.com/premiumlite), 
it’s great to be able to watch videos without having to deal with ads. As
someone who spends a lot of time on YouTube, this subscription has made a huge
difference in my viewing experience. I no longer have to sit through ads that I
don’t care about, and I can just focus on the content that I want to watch.

Talking about advertisement, [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io) is another service
that I pay for. I used to have [PiHole](https://pi-hole.net), then switched to 
[AdGuard](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome), but since Raspberry Pis
are hard to buy today, I prefer to **pay this service rather than maintain it** 
at home. I can now enjoy my online experience without being constantly bombarded
by ads, and I think it’s worth the cost, considering that is way more stable
than a RPi. Not only that, but I would switch to AdGuard, but I _avoid running
any Russian developed software_ until the end of the war.

[LanguageTool](http://languagetool.org/) is a European-funded, multi-language 
tool that I discovered after using Grammarly for a long time, it has full API 
access and integration with 
[Slack, Mail, and more native macOS apps](https://languagetool.org/mac-desktop). 
This tool has been a great help for me, as I use it for both my personal and
professional writing. _Heck!_ I am using it right now to write this post! :wink: 
It’s great that it supports **multiple languages**, and the fact that it has full
API access and integration with other apps is a massive plus 
([Obsidian](https://languagetool.org/insights/post/product-obsidian/) and
LibreOffice plugins are available).

[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) is an open-source and (optionally)
self-hosted alternative to the now bloated 1Password. Even if it is written in
C#, there is a 
[slimmer version of the backend re-written in Rust](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) 
that can run on a raspberry pi without many issues. I pay for the service mostly
to keep the security and keep developing it. It might not have the best UI, or
slick design, but it at least they did not disappointed me :cry: 
_More on that later!_

Email privacy is something that I value. [SimpleLogin](http://simplelogin.io/) 
is a valuable service that even though it has been bought by Proton, it offers
more than Apple/iCloud Hide My mail because **I can own my email domain**. I
have more control over my emails and, which is great in case of leaks or spam. 
I also like that it’s been bought by Proton, as it gives me more confidence in
the security and privacy of my email. SimpleLogin is also open source and can
be self-hosted. :sweat_smile: _though I prefer to pay rather to
run an email server!_ 


# Services I am not paying anymore I have stopped paying for several
subscriptions that I found were not worth the cost or no longer met my needs.
One of those is Netflix. I used to enjoy the wide range of content that it
offered, but over time, the content that I cared about was removed, and the new
things are not interesting to me. I would rather not subscribe just for one
single TV show. So, the trick "that show that keep you subscribed" does not work
to me

There is a service that I have been paying for more than 6 years now, and
recently, I realized it was not worth it: ProtonMail, from being an end-to-end
email provider, it became just a glorified encryption at rest with PGP that
can’t keep up with features that others can. I used to appreciate the level of
security that ProtonMail provided, but as time went on, I found that it was
lacking in certain features that other email providers offered. Their support
for open-source software was good, as well as their way of being transparent.
Sadly, the dream of having end-to-end encrypted email turned out unrealistic
unless everybody uses ProtonMail or PGP/GPG encryption in their client. This
meant that my PGP key is only used at rest and to encrypt a limited number of
emails from Facebook (really, that is the only service that allows to receive
PGP emails).

One that got in disuse is the Nintendo Switch Online: I rarely use my Switch
since I got my Steam Deck at the beginning of this year. I found that the Steam
Deck offered a wider range of games and better graphics, and it was more
convenient for me to play on my computer rather than on my Switch. I also found
that the subscription cost for Nintendo Switch Online was not really useful, and
the included emulators are fun, but I never used them. So, I have decided not to
pay anymore.

The Danish postal system automatically notifies me and tracks on the official
App when a new parcel is coming to my address or has my email/phone number. I
found that the official postal service app was more convenient and more reliable
than the Parcel App, that I was paying for. It supports Amazon and a lot of
tracking services, so if you are not in Denmark, I strongly suggest it!

Should we talk about dating apps? I have been paying for years for Grindr
Xtra...  it has never been worth it, and NextDNS blocks Ads perfectly. I found
out that the services offered were not that good and the app kept crashing and
having issues. When I lost all my chats (yeah it is not a myth) I lost it and
decided not to pay for the app.

1Password is the worst one so far. Since they switched from an ultra-fast and
stable native app to an Electron-based app, I uninstalled it and unsubscribed.
It is clear that they are now focusing more on enterprise and business, but I am
still annoyed about how they went for the money rather than for the UX and
customer fidelity. I found that the new electron-based client was slow and
bloated, and I didn’t like the direction the company was going in. After more
than 10 years of using it and paying, after switching to their subscription
model, I decided to cancel it. All it took was some messages with the CTO on
Twitter: I felt not understood nor heard about keeping the native app running. I
felt that 1Password switched from being customer-first to be money-driven and
unsecure.
