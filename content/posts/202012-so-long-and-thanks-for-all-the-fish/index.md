description: Due to abuse of IPFS and Filecoin network we are shutting down Siderus Orion and Gateway
---
If you are using [Orion](https://orion.qm64.tech/), Siderus’ IPFS desktop
client, you might have noticed that the app has not received any update during
the last year.

Around a year ago, after noticing an extensive amount of misusage of our IPFS
Gateway to share illegal content, I have decided to redirect the traffic to the
official IPFS Gateway. We took down the servers and IPFS nodes and gateways from
every continent.

The decision was difficult, especially after spending money and a lot of time
building it. I feel there should be an explanation. A few days ago, after
reading [Alessandro Segala's article](https://withblue.ink/2020/11/12/maybe-we-shouldnt-want-a-fully-decentralized-web.html), I had personally decided
to officially stop working on Siderus and Orion project and move everything
under Qm64 as part of experiments worked on.

To clarify, the IPFS network will be stronger than ever, thanks to Filecoin,
but I decided to step out for multiple reasons. One of these is expressed in
Alessandro’s article is the Freedom of Speech. More specifically, even if a lot
of illegal content bombarded Siderus' gateway, some of those can not be
classified under Free Speech. The strong censorship resistance of the network
helps the spreading of content that is illegal. I am referring to the Copyright
content and things that range from revenge porn, websites promoting racism,
xenophobia, and homophobia, to even zoophilia and child pornography. Being part
of the LGBTQ family, I take this matter very seriously as it disturbs me a lot.
It made me think twice about the ethical effects of my projects. I took down
the IPFS Gateway.

Today I am doing even more. **I am taking down the download links of Orion
binaries and builds** and redirecting the traffic to my website. I hope that
Protocol Labs will take this seriously and implement some restrictions for
Filecoin and IPFS. I wish to stop the network and cryptocurrency misusage and to
respect human rights and at the same time keep the noble intent behind the
decentralised technology. As for today, I don’t want to be associated with IPFS,
Filecoin, nor with Protocol Labs, and I don’t want to help to **spread
misinformation, fake news, and content that might hurt other humans like me**.

The good part is that I am taking home a lot of experience with Go, JavaScript,
and decentralized networks. I have met amazing people, amazing contributors and
I am pretty sure that they are already aware. De gustibus non disputandum est as
my mother would say. The Internet, like IPFS and like a knife can be used for
doing good or to harm. I choose to do good and stop using IPFS and Filecoin.

Thanks for understanding
