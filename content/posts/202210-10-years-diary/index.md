I have been writing a journal for the last 10 years. This diary helped me a lot
and I want to write down a few things that I discovered to celebrate this
achievement that I thought it was impossible. At the same time, I wish to help
who is not sure if starting one to do so, or not. Those are my personal
observation.

<!-- more -->

The main reason why I started writing a diary is that I wanted to avoid that
cognitive bias. I also wanted to learn more from myself and discover how I
process emotions and time. When I was 16 I noticed how easy it was for some
people to forget some bad experiences with other people. See how for example
some Italian politician and parties that were racist, xenophobic and insulting
other Italians from the south, now all of a sudden, these people are prime
ministers and respected politicians. Sure, people can change… but I want to say
how it is important to remember and evaluate a bigger picture.

I always thought about my idea of time as one of these old movies on tape. One
of those flammable tapes directly from Cinema Paradiso, and we are the little
Toto super curious to see how the story goes. We can always cut the tape and
re-arrange it, give some editing. Hell, yeah, even some CGI if we like! But that
is precisely the issue: Time flows, and I noticed how my brain can re-arrange it
to make me feel sad or happy about almost anything. To me, writing down my
memories helps to keep the story coherent. If some editing happens, that is ok.
I will be aware of both the stories: the one that I lived on the same day I
wrote on the journal, and the one that I want to remember.

I met so many people who gave me such big joy in my life. For one reason or
another, they are no longer characters in my movie. Some are no longer with us,
some others didn't pay their bills, and others moved on to the next chapter of
their movie. In any case, I still remember both the happiness and the sadness
that they caused me in different moments, without holding any specific feelings.

Those were different part of my movie, those were different chapters of the
story and different people.

## I write to improve myself

I learned a lot more in the last 5 years thanks to the diary about compassion,
towards other people and towards myself. For example, one thing that I have
noticed during the last 10 years by reading is how easy it is to go back and
say: Oh! That was stupid of me!  It is super easy to have regrets or feel
ashamed of something that happened. My diary gives me the instrument to reflect
on my reflection when I look back: I assume that it is normal to want to do
better, even if the things that we want to do better are in the past. That is
a valid point to improve ourselves. 

The important thing about regrets is to know that we are learning so that if
something similar happens in the future, we will know what happened. We are
more than allowed to be ashamed of it, too. It is in the past.

## Being present and living the moment

I have to be personal here. I noticed how writing a diary and forcing myself to
describe as much as possible the details helped me to be present. Likewise, I
still struggle a lot with it, and sometimes time just flows too quickly. Writing
down what I saw, the emotions, the sensations, or small details of my experience
does not only enrich me to the story telling, but it allows me to teleport
mentally when I am reading back again the page.

What do I use and how often?

I have been using Day One for the last 10 years. It is a decent journaling
software that has superb features like tags, geolocation and a nice text editor.
I tried to move to other solutions unsuccessfully. It works perfectly with my
iPhone, iPad, and Mac. At the beginning, I was writing it every day or even
more, it was my companion before going to bed, but now it is my way to reanalyze
special events in my life. In the last 3/4 years, after burning out at work, I
found myself writing once or twice a week. Being honest, I feel guilty of not
writing every day anymore. I am scared of forgetting things, missing memories
and not calming my mind down.

## This show has everything!

I wrote almost the entirety of my 20s, vacations, birthdays, love affairs, work
trips, funerals, and sometimes even hookups. Toto from Cinema Paradiso might say
that this tape is a perfect pilot for a TV show instead of a single movie! Why
limiting to a long feature film when you can have:

* a spy episode about me trying to organize a surprise birthday party
* a thriller, the one when I drank far too much with the wrong people
* an adventure one, about dates and hookups on Grindr and trips around the world
* an adult-themed one about exploring sexuality and experimenting
* a comedy episode about that time I had a seizure in the cinema
* a sci-fi one where I talk about work and projects that I never finished
* a LGBTQ+ horror one about that time I got hurt by a homophobic guy 
* a dramatic episode when you feel alone because you live abroad
* a love story filled with plot twists about finding friends and the right man

Even if the story will be inconsistent and too few recurring characters, I am
sure Trixie and Katya would say that [this](https://youtu.be/6nvDC9YSMvQ?t=1310)

[everything](https://youtu.be/jKMGFaF1YbE?t=1034): drama, love,
suspense, sex, blood, and laughs... and Toto would love it too!

Seriously speaking, I do suggest writing a journal! Be aware: It is a habit that
takes time, as going to the gym or learning a new language. It takes time and I
found it helped me to achieve other goals.
