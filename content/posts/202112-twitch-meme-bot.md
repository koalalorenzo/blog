During the dark side of quarantine, I had to keep my hands busy, and instead of
writing on this blog (_sorry_!) I started streaming on Twitch instead. To add
some interactivity with my viewers, I decided to add my own bot to display
custom Images and GIFs with a text that my viewers could decided. Using it was
fun, but building it in Go was even more fun!

## The Bot Idea

The Idea is simple. If you write on my chat while I stream something like:

```yaml
!meme hello Hey Lorenzo!
```

It will show you something like this on my stream:

![My Live Stream](/images/202112/hello-example.webp#small)

This was fun because at times, people could generate Memes based on what was
happening on the screen, and since I have been playing a lot of Dead By
Daylight, there were plenty of moments to have fun creating new images.

I have decided to make it using [Go](https://go.dev) and hosting it on
[Heroku](https://heroku.com). If you want to skip straight to the app running
your can do it [here](https://koalalorenzo-twitch-meme-gen.herokuapp.com) and
you can check the
[soruce code here](http://gitlab.com/koalalorenzo/twitch-meme-generator), where
you can follow the instructions on how to deploy it on your own Twitch channel!

## Building it was fun because it was challenging
I was building this live, while streamign and using the viewers as
[rubber ducks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)! In general
there were a few challenges like: _How do I connect to Twitch_? _How can I make an
OBS connect to the Image_? _How do I generate Imanges in Go_?
_How can I make it easy to deploy_? and also,
_what should be the name of the bot_? ðŸ¤£

### Twitch uses IRC for chat
At the beginning I was thinking about using a full-blown Twitch Bot, but setting
it up would have been way more complex than needed. Instead I have discovered
that [Twitch uses IRC](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc) (or sort of) for every
stream. This means that I don't have to deal necessarely with authentication
unless I need to write to the channel. Since the bot is just listening,
[I found a go module](https://github.com/gempir/go-twitch-irc) that would just
listen to the IRC interface. Jackpot!

### Ingredients: WebSockets, HTTP, API and Headers, UI


### Genearting Images and GIFS, but FASTER!
This part was a little tedius, but I was lucky to find a Go module that would
exactly generate Images and GIFs based on text imput. Even if it was old,
[jpoz/gomeme](https://github.com/jpoz/gomeme) was working fine... except for one
little detail: the image size and formats. Let me explain why:

[James](https://github.com/jpoz)'s module supports GIFs, PNG, and JPEGs. 
Those formats could be quite heavy and slow to manipulate. Infact one of the 
GIFs that I am using as an example, called `yeah`, it is a 
**whopping 23MB in size**! ðŸ˜± This means that it takes from **2 to 3 seconds** 
to generate, and display into OBS Browser Source and on my stream.

The solution to this is to implement where possible 
[WebP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP): a new image standard 
[developed by Google](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp)
that is way lighter than PNGs, JPEGs and GIFs! During my test, the 
[23MB GIF](https://gitlab.com/koalalorenzo/twitch-meme-generator/-/blob/63b969bc98b97d94550e0e53fb368e1124f50d4d/assets/yeah.69.gif?expanded=true&viewer=rich),
became 
[4MB Animated WebP](https://gitlab.com/koalalorenzo/twitch-meme-generator/-/blob/d3ba69eb50726810bc5423b7586723a5334aff63/assets/yeah.69.webp). 
_It is still a big file_, but it will be faster to process. ðŸŽ‰


To do so I had to create my 
[own fork of the module](https://gitlab.com/koalalorenzo/gomeme). My fork sadly 
does requires GCC as there is no official `image/webp` package in the Go 
standard library... ðŸ˜­ and on top of that I was able to find only libraries that  
are actually using C code to deal with WebP and Animated WebP. So due to time 
constraints I added support for WebP only for static Images... ðŸ¤ž hoping to 
upgrade to Animated WebP when the Go standard library will implement them.

Using my own fork of Jame's Go module, made some of the images faster to display
but I kept the source to display PNGs, JPEGs and GIFs as I am not expecting
people to use WebP... I could improve the bot to render the images in WebP, but
that is for another time maybe! ðŸ˜‰
